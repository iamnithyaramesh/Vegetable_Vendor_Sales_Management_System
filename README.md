# Vegetable Vendor Sales Management System


## Problem Statement

Developing a system for a vegetable vendor to manage his door-delivery service.
The system should maintain the list of available vegetables for the day. The system should
accept a list of vegetables with the individual quantities required by the customer and assign
order numbers for tracking. The system should be able to generate the bill for the order and confirm the
payment through notifications to the customer and the vendor. The availability of the vegetables should be updated to the vendor and
the customer (during ordering). When the order is ready, a notification should be sent to the
customer mentioning the tentative time of delivery.
